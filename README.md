## Deprecation Note (v3)
:warning: Please note that Sendbirdâ€™s SDK v3 will be deprecated by **July 2023**. You may still use the older SDKs at your choice, but no new updates or bug fixes will be made to SDK v3.

**We recommend clients to plan their migration to SDK v4 as early as possible as there are breaking changes.** We also provide prioritized support for migration and any issues related to v4. SDK v4 provides far richer and robust features in Websocket, Local caching, Polls, Scheduled Messages, Pinned Message, and many more. So try it out now!

## Introduction

[Sendbird](https://sendbird.com) provides the chat API and SDK for your app, enabling real-time communication among the users. Here are various samples built using Sendbird Chat SDK.

- [Chat Swift sample](#chat-swift-sample) has core chat features. Group channel and open channel are the two main channel types in which you can create various subtypes where users can send and receive messages. This sample is written in Swift with [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework).

- [Chat Objective-C sample](#chat-objective-c-sample) has core chat features. Group channel and open channel are the two main channel types in which you can create various subtypes where users can send and receive messages. This sample is written in Objective-C with [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework).

- [SyncManager Swift sample](#syncmanager-sample-swift-only) is equipped with a local cache along with core chat features. For faster data loading and caching, the sample synchronizes with the Sendbird server and saves a list of group channels and the messages within the local cache into your client app. This sample is written in Swift with [Sendbird SyncManager SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-syncmanager-ios) and [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework). Find more about SyncManager on [Sendbird SyncManager document](https://sendbird.com/docs/syncmanager/v1/ios/getting-started/about-syncmanager).
